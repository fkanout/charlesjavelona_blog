Looking for a developer? {header}

Are you looking for a professional, communicative & reliable software developer with extensive full-stack web development skills for your next project? {sub}

If you have an application you are interested in developing with web technology, I’d love to work with you on it. I’m a full-stack developer which means I can bring your project from concept to completion. I work primarily with Node.js and Django on the back-end and React.js or Angular on the front-end but picking up new languages or frameworks isn’t a problem. 

I’m available for hire on a freelance or contract basis. Why not send me an email to khalilstemmler@gmail.com to discuss it further?

### Skills

Working as a freelance developer, it’s not just about the code. I understand the challenges of working remotely on client projects. Here’s a couple of things I think I’m good at:
{% raw %}
<ul class="contact-skill-list">
  <li><span class="skill-item">Communication —</span> I realize the importance of good communication. I use tools like Slack to make sure we’re always on the same page.</li>
  <li><span class="skill-item">Organization —</span> I believe it’s important to stay organised while working remotely. I use the likes of Trello, Asana & Basecamp to help keep projects on-track and under control.</li>
  <li><span class="skill-item">Timekeeping —</span> I value my clients’ time and always aim to work efficiently. I account-for and track everything I do using services such as Toggl.</li>
  <li><span class="skill-item">Management —</span> I think it’s important to identify the discrete stages of a project and work to a schedule around those.</li>
  <li><span class="skill-item">Collaboration —</span> I play well with others. I’m happy to integrate into your existing team to help get your project implemented.</li>
  <li><span class="skill-item">Development —</span> On a technical level, I have a degree in computer science and therefore recognize the importance of applying proper software development techniques to the web.</li>
  <li><span class="skill-item">Design —</span> While I’m not a graphic designer, I have an appreciation and eye for good design. I’m comfortable using Photoshop, Illustrator and Sketch and can take designs from mock-up to implementation.</li>
  <li><span class="skill-item">Documentation —</span> Often overlooked, I think it’s incredibly important to leave clients with a clear picture of what’s been done for the next round of development.</li>
</ul>
{% endraw %}

### Who I Like To Work With
Having worked with a variety of clients, I’ve realized that I really enjoy working with clients that exhibit certain traits. I am able to produce my best work when my client is **trusting**, **detail-oriented**, **reliable**, **decisive** and **business-oriented**. 

If this sounds like you and you're interested, send me an email at khalilstemmler@gmail.com and I'll get back to you promptly.
