This is something that I'm still very much learning how to do myself.

My team's first project didn't make me feel very good because the client has an idea of what they expect and we have an understanding of what we need to do but without the document actually outlining every detail of development and thing.

Too often, we as developers and engineers forget that regular people are regular people and don't understand what a system call is. We can't expect our clients to already know what a persona is and why it's important- so let's just always be safe and document the hell out of the entire project before we even write any code or do any user research.
