So you want to make a Mac Demarco-sounding song? I think I did it by accident. Here's how you can be just like Mac.

<!-- more --> 

# 1. All of the Chorus Effects on your Guitars
You know what a chorus effect is? Yeah, that thing. The Cocteau Twins. Yeah, you remember that Mac Demarco song that didn't have chorus on it? No? Me neither.

If it has 6 strings and you're going to use it to make your song, make sure it runs through a chorus effect.

I don't have an actual chorus pedal on hand so I used my shitty GearBox "Sine Chorus" effect. I also made this into a preset anytime I want to make new Mac songs. {figure}


# 2. Jazz Chord Progression
Mac is a total jazzman, at least in the majority of his newer stuff.

Pick 3 or 4 jazz chords and start playing with them until something sounds alright. 

Make sure you play it really nice and chill.

What's a jazz chord? "I only play Green Day covers", you say? Pfft, I myself don't even really know what the heck jazz chords are either. Here, if you spend 10 minutes over here, you should be ok to move onto the next part. (http://pickupjazz.com/beginner-jazz-guitar-chords/)

Most of my favourite Mac Songs, if not all of them, have a plucked lead guitar that drives the main melody. Use the first chord that you chose for your jazz progression and pluck around that a little bit.

# 3. Add Really Simple Drums
Mac tends to keep it pretty simple on the drums for the most part, I feel like. 

Make sure you add a small little double snare hit somewhere in there after every few bars.

Throw in some EZDrummer patterns and you're set.

I use EZDrummer within FL studio. Highly recommend checking it out. {figure}

# 4. Pitch The Song Down When You Mix It
In the heart of "Rock And Roll Night Club", pitch that song down a few cents to give it that "drunken time warp" feel. 

Hey! Now you know how to make a Mac Demarco-sounding song. I'm actually really looking forward to hearing yours. Maybe we should all make a Mac-styled compilation album. Ou, that would be fun.

FYI #1: This song was an accident. A drunk accident if I'm being perfectly honest. It wasn't until I listened to it the next day that I realized I had a new idea for a blog post. 

FYI #2: This song has to 100% be a total rip of "Another One".
