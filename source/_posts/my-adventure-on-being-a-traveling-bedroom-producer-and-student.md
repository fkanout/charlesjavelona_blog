I’ve been a student-musician living away from home for about 4 years now. During my time at post-secondary schools and co-op work terms, I’ve lived on campus, off-campus, in basement rooms, in townhouses and in detached houses. 

<!-- more --> 

It was kind of a pain to find a new place just about every 4 months and pack up all my things to move to a different campus or a different city for co op. Especially difficult for someone who carries around a lot of musical instruments and gear as well.

When I first started at Brock University, I brought all of my gear with me (bass, guitars, amp, monitors, midi controllers, interfaces, pedals, cords, etc) and it was actually pretty sweet having all of my stuff there. It was a decently large room in Village even though I had to tuck a few things underneath my bed.

In between being scared straight at the thought of doing bad in school and lifelessly studying for math tests I’d find a slice of time to do some recording. My house-mates were really cool and wouldn’t bother me while I was in my room doing my thing and I generally felt like it was a good creative environment. The only thing inhibiting my creativity was the fear of being too loud and disturbing my studying neighbors (this would be a recurring theme in the years to come).

I made pretty good use of my monitors, this pair of Puma Headphones and my Flat Sennheiser monitoring headset as I spent about an entire semester mixing my work to sound like Massive Attack’s “Mezzanine”.

Then came time to move out and that's when I realized:

 "I have way too much shit."
I was worried that I was going to have to make two trips (god, what a stupid idea it was to bring that mini fridge) but somehow we managed to get out of there in a single trip.

Still not learning from my mistakes, the next place I lived at was an off-campus detached house and I brought EVERYTHING. This however, happened to work out for me really nicely and was one of the best places I had to work on music because I shared the entire carpeted basement with a really easy-going friend from high school and the people who lived upstairs were too timid or scared to even acknowledge my existence, let alone complain about the noise.

Living in a basement room in Ottawa was a different story and came to be how I put together my “red bag” which is a bag containing all the absolute necessities including my Toneport UX2 audio interface, misc cords, headphones and a mic. Leaving my pedals at home and only bringing my electric guitar and amp, I came to realize that VST plugins really are your best friend.

Using FL Studio 9, I did all my guitar tones and effects through running my guitar into my amp and then in to the audio interface where I could map the audio to a channel in FL Studio and throw on Guitar Rig 5. Even made up for the fact that I didn’t have a bass with me at the time by making my guitar sound like a bass. The only thing that I couldn’t make better with technology was the fact that I didn’t want to sing too loudly for too long and piss off my landlord upstairs.

Returning to Oakville for Summer classes, I caught a sweet deal where I subletted an entire townhouse to myself for the price of one room due to everyone being gone for the Summer. This was by far the best place that I ever had to work. I would sit by the living room table and code, work on networking labs and music; all the while noticing straight ahead critters such as rabbits and squirrels running up to the glass screen door.

One of my context credits that semester was called Intro To Creativity and it was definitely the guiltiest credit I ever obtained. For the final project, I just presented a song that I wrote before I even started the course and returned home to an email that I received 100% on it.

The instructor did stress how important it is to creators to have the right “creative space”; I totally agree. I’ve had some pretty shitty creative spaces over these 4 years and for me, this was one of the greatest inhibitors to my creativity.

Some see the creative process model as being broken into 4 parts: 1) preparation, 2) incubation, 3) illumination and 4) verification. The stage where you’re actually letting your mind wander and work through the creation of a song is the second stage: incubation. As an exercise, I spent a few weeks listening to music spanning a diverse variety of genres before allowing myself to do any recording. When I entered the incubation stage, I just let myself create whatever was going to be created; I didn’t jump to enter the Verification (4) stage while I was still in stage 2.

During those few months from May – August 2015, I put together a bunch of stuff spanning from inspirations such as The Beastie Boys, The Birthday Party, Gorillaz, Head Wound City, Rowland S. Howard, Holy Molar, Sonic Youth, DJ Shadow, etc. As I write this and I’m working on organizing my next release into something cohesive and have over 50 songs (post punk, pop, thrash punk, trip-hop) from the past year that don’t really have any common musical or lyrical theme.

School keeps me really busy. School has often kept me from finding time to be able to support my releases and finding the right people over a 4-month span to join me on stage. I’m just lucky that I love my program and I love what I do.

With just about a year left of school, I’m curious to see if life in the working world will allow me to find time to get back into performing the songs that I write. My guess is yes because I don’t think after school I’ll be spending 17 hour days doing networking labs and technical write-ups.
