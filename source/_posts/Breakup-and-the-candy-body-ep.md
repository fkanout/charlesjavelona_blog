Ever since I was a kid, my mom used to always tell me that I was not very good at adapting to change. I used to hate going on road trips or anything that meant that my comfortable environment was at stake.

I'm very much realizing that this is just part of my personality. Change is really scary to me, yeah; but without it, I think I'd miss out on a lot of things in life.

As we near the end of the year, I've been stressing a little bit about what's going to happen in January for work, what's going on with my schooling amidst this strike amongst all of the colleges in Canada, getting more serious planning my freelance career, lifestyle and how I'm going to be able to take a single Brock credit in addition to all of these uncertainties. 

To top things off, my girlfriend and I broke up. This was probably the hardest to manage out of all of the different changes happening because it was really nice having that support model from someone I cared deeply about. Even though things around me were changing, one really important aspect of my life was still intact. And then it wasn't. This left me feeling like nothing about 2018 was going to be the same at all.

Post-breakup, I found myself not remembering how to make myself happy and needed to take a few days off from working to really re-adjust myself.

It took me a week or so of karaoke, working out and leaning on good friends that I sort of abandoned during my relationship find myself in the right place to do some meaningful reflection. I'm a 22 year old man and I'm still learning a lot about love and relationships:

And I've learned that it's important to stick to what's true to you. Your happiness doesn't need to be contingent on another person. Post-relationship, my self-esteem was damaged and it clouded a lot of my day to day life. After some time, I was able to remember something very important about myself:

2 weeks later, I'm feeling much happier and much more productive. That fire to create and accomplish my goals is back and I attribute a large part of my recovery to converting a sleepless night into a [__short Cyanide Canaries EP__](https://cyanidecanaries.bandcamp.com/album/candy-body-ep). 

I realized that for the duration of my relationship, I wasn't making any music. Noticing this was shocking to me because it's something I've been doing my entire life and it brings me a lot of joy, creating. 

Looking back, this year has been a year of tremendous growth an all fronts; professionally and spiritually. I learned a lot of things but I think one that's incredibly relevant as I start to tackle my freelancing lifestyle full force is to never forget what makes you happy and why you started doing what you're doing in the first place.
