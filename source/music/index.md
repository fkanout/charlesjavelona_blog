#### Debutante
![Alternative Text](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0009394230_100.png "Callbacks")
"gritty textures, dangerous intimations, and a sense of caustic longing... DEBUTANTE is the belle of the ball, and kids the auditorium is definitely on fire... defined by sharp grooves and razor-rainstorm guitars, this music revisits the early 80s postpunk moment without any of the usual pained nostalgia. these songs want to hurt you the way you hurt them." - Caligula Jr, resident psychedelic cave monster

**Debutante EP** - released June 17, 2017 ([Bandcamp](https://debutante-band.bandcamp.com/releases), [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/cyanidecanaries/sets/debutante-debutante-ep))
