I'm an 'almost' post-graduate student and musician currently living in Toronto, Ontario.

With about 6 years experience in Computer Science and Software Development, I've done co-ops and worked for really awesome companies like __IBM__, __Pinnaca__, __iCare Home Health__, __Jomar Softcorp__ and built products and websites for small businesses and startups.

As I finish my final semester of university, I'm working as an independent freelance web & software developer, blogging about what I learn each week, running a startup and playing music when I find the time.
