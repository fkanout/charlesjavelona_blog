# Where I am in my journey

Part-time student in my last semester, working and living in the Greater Toronto Area.

I've been a Comp Sci student for 5 years and managed to gain about 3 years practical development experience working for awesome companies like __IBM__, __Pinnaca__, __iCare Home Health__, and __Jomar Softcorp__ in addition to building [a startup](http://oakvillenews.org/univjobs-boosts-job-opportunities-ontario/) and working client contracts.

My professional goal is to find remote employment with a company that builds beautiful products using the latest web development technologies, employs passionate people and fosters lifelong learning.

My personal goal is to be a part of a community of like-minded artists, engineers and creatives to make art, tech and experiences that are unique and memorable.

If my personal and professional goals collide, I'm a complete man.

# Core Competencies

I consider myself a JavaScript specialist with a very strong background in computer networking and databases.

I know a lot of different languages and frameworks (I'm always learning a new one), but I prefer to talk about core software development skills because I can pick up new languages and frameworks without a problem. 

Having built my own startup, I have a deep understanding of a modern application development. I have professional experience designing applications from concept to inception. I'm highly knowledgeable in areas such as:

- Software development design patterns
- Templating & routing
- API Design patterns
- Security principles
- Product life-cycle
- UI/UX design
- Project management and collaboration with Git and Asana
- Continuous integration tools
- SQL, data modeling and design

Additionally, because I completed a degree in Internet Communications Technology, I have these skills:

• Deep understanding of TCP/IP
• Web and app server configuration
• Experience pen-testing with TCPDump, Wireshark and NMap
• Strong Linux networking stack understanding; experience with IPtables and Conntrack 
• Cisco IOS, Juniper JunOS
• MPLS VPNs (L2, L3) / ATOM
• OSPF, EIGRP, IS-IS, BGP, VoIP, Asterisk PBX
• VirtualBox, VMware, GNS3
• Windows Active Directory
• Amazon Web Services

I prefer software development over network engineering and dev ops but I think that my knowledge of the Internet and what actually happens at every layer has made me a stronger software developer.

# My Story

I first started programming in high school - taking Java classes, learning the basics, and playing minecraft during breaks. I wasn't very good at programming at the time (actually, I'd say that some of my friends were a lot better than I was). After the first few weeks, classes suddenly felt shorter and I kept getting more and more into the realm of possibility for things that could be created with code. 

I can actually remember the moment that I told myself that "THIS is what I want to be great at in life".

To raise funds for my first few years of university for Computer Science and Network Telecommunications at Brock, I started a local lawn care business in my hometown of Brantford, Ontario while attending high school. I ran that business every summer for about 3 and a half years (my stepdad still runs it during the summers, he loves working outside).

When I got into university and started doing co-op placements, I took to learning more about web development and entrepreneurship in my spare time.

Eventually, I had enough skills to start taking on client work during my studies building web sites, writing custom backend logic and crafting a startup with my peers from Sheridan College.

I'm hungry to become the best developer I can be. I love leading projects, I love being challenged, and I love learning new languages, tools, and frameworks. While my technical interests vary every couple of months as I'm learning new things, my current list of topics I'm particlarly passionate about are:

- agile software development practices
- identifying high leverage tasks
- scaling distributed systems
- test driven development
- UI/UX design
- Ruby on Rails
- JavaScript
- Shopify app development
- digial audio processing and synths
- robotics
