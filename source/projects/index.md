#### Univjobs
![Univjobs](/images/proj/univjobs.png "Univjobs.")
Univjobs is a platform that we built for students to connect to work, internships and gigs near campus. Just hitting 100+ users, we wanted to build a recruiting platform to make it easier for employers to find the right co-ops and new hires, and easier for small business owners to post their first job postings.

Our Full-Stack JavaScript platform is built on AWS and uses React/Redux + NodeJS/Express. As CTO, I design and implement all aspects of our technology stack from back to front including Caching, Authentication, Marketing Automation, Network Architecture and Database Security, Front-end Web Development, API Design, etc. I work with our Chief Design Officer and CEO to promote an Agile environment in order to shape our product into a tool that our users love. Also, I work with our DevOps Engineer to constantly enhance our workflow and speed up development.

My day-to-day operations can be summarized by finding the most effective way to push the product and our company forward.
