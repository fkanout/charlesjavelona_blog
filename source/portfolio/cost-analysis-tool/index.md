Lynch Fluids Control Inc. is a hydraulic components company responsible for designing, manufacturing, integrating & distributing to the mobile & industrial markets. 

Lynch contracted a software project through my school to build a Cost Analysis Tool so that operators could determine the profitability of items manufactured in real-time. 

I constructed a front-end application with React / Redux, taught my team modern web development practices, and designed and oversaw the development an API in PHP using Slim Framework utilizing live data from their distributed machining databases.

While I can't share the source code for this project, I'd be happy to talk with you in more detail about the problem we solved.
