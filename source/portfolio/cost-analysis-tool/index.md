[Lynch Fluids Control Inc](http://www.lynch.ca/). is a hydraulic components company responsible for designing, manufacturing, integrating & distributing to the mobile & industrial markets. 

Lynch contracted a software project through my school to build a Cost Analysis Tool so that operators could determine the profitability of items manufactured in real-time. 

I constructed a front-end application with React / Redux, taught my team modern web development practices, designed, and oversaw the development an API in PHP using Slim Framework utilizing live data from their distributed machining databases.

While I can't share the source code for this project, I'd be happy to talk with you in more detail about the problem we solved.

I did however, manage to publish a reusable React component on [GitHub](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/react-quant-breakdown) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quant-breakdown) for visualizing qualitative processes breakdowns. To my developer friends, feel free to use it in your own projects and contribute if you like!
