Univjobs is a platform that we built for students to connect to work, internships and gigs near campus. Just hitting 300+ users, we wanted to build a recruiting platform to make it easier for employers to find the right co-ops and new hires, and easier for small business owners to post their first job postings.

Our Full-Stack JavaScript platform is built on AWS and uses React/Redux + NodeJS/Express. 

I currently work part-time as CTO of Univjobs. 90% of my time is spent on high leverage activities about 10% is spent delegating tasks and assisting my team.

I've designed all aspects of our technology stack from back to front including authentication, network infrastructure, front-end architecture, marketing automation, API and data model design. I work with our Chief Design Officer, DevOps Engineer and Junior Developer in agile sprints in order to use feedback to drive the product towards being a tool that users love and will tell all their friends.

We were recently mentioned in the Oakville news:

As an entrepreneur, building Univjobs after participating in YCombinator's Startup School has been one of the most fulfilling experiences in my software development career so far.
