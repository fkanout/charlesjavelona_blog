# What is Univjobs?

Basically, being a broke college/university student wasn't fun. We wanted to see if we could help people find gigs and part-time jobs that were actually related to their area of study so that they could pay for groceries while learning something.

The pretty way to say it is that "Univjobs is a platform that we built for students to connect to work, internships and gigs near campus".

As a developer, creating Univjobs after participating in YCombinator's Startup School and learning all of the modern web tools, practices and methodologies has been one of the most fulfilling and valuable experiences in my software development career so far.

# What did I do?

- Led the development and assisted on the design of the Univjobs student recruitment platform.
- Full stack development using Node.js, Express, React, Redis, AWS, and MariaDB.

I've always believed that the best way to learn a new tool or a framework is to have a project to learn it on. Univjobs has been the project that I've used to learn CI/CD, testing frameworks, agile workflows, Webpack, Gulp, React, Redux, etc.
