Etherwatch was a 4th year research project into the inner workings of IPTables and an exploration of cloud networking as opposed to traditional networking. 

Working in a team of 3, we created an Ionic mobile app that reported AWS Cloudwatch logs of a VPC's network components in real-time.

I actually wrote a blog post about the entire research project [here](/2018/01/22/Etherwatch-Cloud-Monitoring-Research-Project/).
