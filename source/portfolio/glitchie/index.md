I've always been attracted to dissonant art and music. When I first encountered Glitch art back in 2012, I wanted to see if I could figure out how to create it myself.

Glitchie is a desktop application written in Java that allows you to databend photos and undo databends (particularly tricky to do).

This was written overnight during a caffeine-fueled hangout with a couple of friends.
