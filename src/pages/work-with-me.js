        <p>Interested in working with me? Awesome! I'm excited to meet
    you, learn more about your project, and find out ways that I
    can help you meet your goals.</p>

        <p>Before we do that, I'd like to just tell you a little bit more about
    the type of work that I do- that way, you can decide if we'd be
    a good fit to work together.</p>

        <Divider/>

        <p>I work with small to medium-sized businesses of all kinds
    looking to sell more stuff using <b>Shopify</b>. I can help you:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>develop custom Shopify apps</li>
          <li>build your custom storefront and meet complex
    requirements</li>
          <li>utilize <a href="https://www.shopify.ca/blog/the-complete-guide-to-ab-testing#whatisit">A/B testing</a>, email automation, analytics,
    and design experience to convert more traffic into paying
    customers</li>
        </ul>

        {
          this.state.todo.RESOURCE_BLOG_DONE
            ? <p>You can <Link to="/resources/20-tips">learn more</Link> about the kinds of things you can do to
    ensure your ecommerce store is performing at it's full potential.</p>
            : ''
        }
        

        <p>
          Shopify is the {
            this.state.todo.BLOG_POSTS_DONE 
              ? <Link to="/why-shopify">best ecommerce platform</Link>
              : <a href={'https://www.mlveda.com/blog/10-reasons-why-shopify-is-the-best-option/'}>best ecommerce platform</a>
          } for any new business
    to build their store on- it's why I've chosen it as the backbone
    of my freelance business. If you're established on a different
    platform (such as WooCommerce) and would like to stay there,
    or you have an entirely non-ecommerce related project (an app,
    website, some custom scripting), there are also a number of 
    <Link to="/services"> other services</Link> that I offer and can do really well.
        </p>

        <p>
          The projects I work on have a budget of at least $300 and
    are undertaken directly with clients who are looking to leverage
    my expertise to get results.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you始re looking for a partner for ongoing work, I offer
    retainer packages starting at $1,000/month.
        </p>

        <p>
          I might not be a great fit for you if:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>you're an agency or a developer looking to subcontract work</li>
          <li>you're not comfortable working with a remote developer</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          As for me, I love working with clients who:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>are detail-oriented</li>
          <li>are decisive</li>
          <li>like me!</li>
        </ul>
