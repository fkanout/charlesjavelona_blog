I'm Khalil, a freelance web designer / developer specializing in Ecommerce theme and application development, particularly on Shopify.

My background is as a software and network engineer, and Iʼve worked with numerous platforms, web frameworks and languages. 

I'm also the CTO of [Univjobs](https://univjobs.ca), a student recruitment platform that helps recent grads
connect to meaningful employment.

I write and speak about JavaScript, web design, development and business strategy in
Ecommerce.

When I'm not hacking away, I'm usually spending time with loved ones or making [music](https://soundcloud.com/cyanidecanaries/sets/cyanide-canaries-a).

You can [reach out](/contact) to me if you'd like to chat — let's grab a coffee if
you're in the GTA.
