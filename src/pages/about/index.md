I'm Khalil, a software developer / designer specializing in Ecommerce.

I fell in love with coding and tech ever since my first programming class in Grade 9. 

Since then, I've earned my Bachelors in Computer Science, my Diploma in Internet Networking and worked at companies of varying size such as IBM, Pinnaca Softcorp, and JOMAR in Software roles learning and building things with dozens of web frameworks and languages.

My freelance journey started during my study where I balanced school and building apps, sites and tools for companies. 

I enjoy the opportunity to work on different projects and I'm fortunate to have worked with some pretty cool clients.

I'm currently the CTO of [Univjobs](https://univjobs.ca), a student recruitment platform I built that helps recent grads
connect to meaningful employment.

I write and speak about JavaScript, web design, development and business strategy in
Ecommerce.

When I'm not hacking away, I'm usually spending time with loved ones or making [music](https://soundcloud.com/cyanidecanaries/sets/cyanide-canaries-a).

You can [reach out](/contact) to me if you'd like to chat â€” if you're in the GTA, let's go grab a coffee!
