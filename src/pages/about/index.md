I'm Khalil, a web designer / developer specializing in helping businesses with the
development of custom Shopify applications.

My background is as a software and network engineer, and Iʼve worked with numerous
sorts of platforms, web frameworks and languages.

connect to meaningful employment.

I write and speak about JavaScript, web design, development and business strategy in
Ecommerce.
