# A home for your brand

Shopify differs from marketplace sites like [Etsy ](https://www.etsy.com/ca/)or [Ebay ](https://www.ebay.ca/)in the sense that you have the opportunity to brand your store. On Etsy and Ebay, your store still has the "look and feel" of Etsy and Ebay.

What makes Shopify great is that it's agnostic to design and front end technology. This means that you can completely design your custom storefront and showcase your brand by providing your customers with an entirely unique experience shopping experience. 

For example, [COAL N TERRY](https://shopcoalnterry.com/), a vintage clothing store on Shopify, has cut through the noise in an otherwise very crowded marketplace with their unique branding. Product photography, aesthetic and a good custom theme goes a long way here in building a strong long-running brand that customers will remember and buy from over and over again.

Shopify is also equipped with a respectable analytics dashboard enabling you to see just about anything you need to know about the performance of your store at a glance. 

You can add as many products as you want, customize just about anything from your admin dashboard to your fulfillment process with public or private apps (private apps can be written by any talented freelancer).\
